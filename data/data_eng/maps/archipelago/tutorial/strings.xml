In a tutorial you will be able to learn how to handle all types of weaponry that may be installed on the ships, as well as some features of newly added game mechanics.

		value="Enemy patrol boats have been detected.||The most effective way of dealing with the enemy boats and aircraft is using your anti-aircraft guns. AA guns are assigned to the 5th weapon group by default (Alt key).||Machine guns, that constitute the primary weaponry of patrol boats, can not damage your ship, but in this case the boats are also equipped with MLRS, which pose a threat. Try to maintain speed and maneuver around to avoid being hit."

		value="Ships in HTA:Armada have an ability to repair themselves over time, so if you find yourself in dire straits during the encounter with an enemy, it would be best to retreat and wait for the repairs to complete. Note, however, that the enemy can use this ability just as well."

		value="In the original Hard Truck Apocalypse game, nearly all truck configurations allowed for 360 degree angle of fire. In HTA:Armada, however, you will have to pay closer attention to the firing sectors of the weapons installed on the ship. To be able to fire from all of your weapons at once, try to position yourself in a way to keep the enemy either to the left, or to the right side of your ship. Also, some AA guns can prove to be quite effective against ships (i.e. Auge 47-mm cannon), so try to use all the weaponry that you have effectively."

	<!-- on destruction of destroyer -->
	<string
		id="107"
		value="You're in luck: your guns were loaded with high-explosive shells that are most effective against lightly armored destroyers and ground targets. Keep in mind that if you have to face a large number of enemy cruisers or battleships, it is better to choose armor-piercing shells. The information about the hull types of the enemy ships that may be encountered on missions will be provided at HQ during briefings."

		value="Each destroyer is equipped with two torpedo launchers: one directed to the left (port side), which by default is fired by pressing the Shift key, and the other directed to the right (starboard side), which by default is fired with the Ctrl key. Sometimes the ship may be equipped with torpedo tubes that are directed forward and backward. They are considered as directed to the left and to the right respectively and utilize the same control keys."

	<string

	<string
		id="111"
		value="The torpedo launchers installed on your ship are extremely limited in terms of rotation angles, and require the ship to be directed almost perpendicular to the target. Ensure that TL is aimed at the target before launching the torpedoes. You can take your time, as the enemy cruiser is completely immobilized. Its weapons, however, seem to still be functional."
